# email_parser (Windows)

Parse ost or pst email datafile in working directory automatically via command line or manually.

This tool uses relative path and everything is based on the working directory (path of command line). The datafile must be copied into the working directory and renamed to either "input.ost" or "input.pst". The "email_parser.exe" executable should be placed inside the "libraries" sub-folder in the working directory.

Multiple csv files will be generated inside the "emailtemp" sub-folder in working directory, which must be created before running the tool.

# Working directory structure
Before running the tool
```
-libraries/
    -email_parser.exe
-emailtemp/
-input.xst
-README.md
```
After running the tool
```
-libraries/
    -email_parser.exe
-emailtemp/
    -email_7iWqTD3MgLkFD0YGuNVKSxbSuG8Gfjvg.csv
    -email_9ocujoqrpIACjhP2ThEQMSqhxClU06HG.csv
     ...(the number of files here depends on the structure of the input datafile)...
    -email_b3Z8DrSTvdqvHmE348Kw9L0aHxApdey4.csv
    -email_cEbrK3mBPuOENRNvQaN2WUz7pAGcsWjv.csv
-input.xst
-README.md
```
The tool can be used manually with the layout above kept in mind, but it can also be automated with the code below. Be sure to run the tool multiple times to ensure accuracy, as mentioned in the "Limitations" sections below.
# Sample codes (Python2 for Windows)

First, let's create the necessary sub-folder
```
os.makedirs("emailtemp")
```
Here is how to generate the output
```
if os.path.isdir("emailtemp"):
    os.system('\"'+abspath("libraries/email_parser.exe")+'\"')
```
Below is how to read the multiple csv files generated
```
regexlineslist = []
for filename in os.listdir("emailtemp"):
    if filename.endswith(".csv"):
        with open(os.path.join("emailtemp", filename)) as fpregex:
            for lineregex in csv.reader(x.replace('\0', '') for x in fpregex):
                regexlineslist.append(re.sub(r'(\s|\u180B|\u200B|\u200C|\u200D|\u2060|\uFEFF)+', '',str(lineregex).strip())[2:-2])
```
The following regex can be used to match with emails addresses and timestamps in the list populated in the code above.
```
email = re.compile("^[0-9a-zA-Z_.-]+@[0-9a-zA-Z][0-9a-zA-Z.-]*[0-9a-zA-Z]\.[a-zA-Z]{2,64}$")
timestamps = re.compile("^\d{1,2}[A-Z][a-z]{2}\d{5,6}:\d{2}:\d{2}(a|p)m$")
```
# Limitations
Before using the reading or parsing codes above, it is recommended to run the extraction multiple times to ensure that there was no silent errors the fist time. This is because the tool is not stable when automated and the results have to be verified. Fortunately, there is an easy way to verify the results as shown below. It is recommended to run it 20 times to be safe; but for time-critical situations, 10 times would probably suffice.
```
emailvar6 = 0
def askSequence2():
    global emailvar6
    emailvar6 = raw_input("Enter the number of times to scan the ost/pst file (Recommended min 20): ")
values2 = list("0123456789")
def remover2(my_string = ""):
  for item in my_string:
    if item not in values2:
      my_string = my_string.replace(item, "")
  return my_string
askSequence2()
while ((int(emailvar6) == 0)or(len(emailvar6) != len(remover2(emailvar6)))):
    print "Invalid input. Please try again."
    askSequence2()

emailvar7 = 1
emailvar8 = 0
while (emailvar7 <= int(emailvar6)):
    try:
        shutil.rmtree("emailtemp")
    except:
        pass
    os.makedirs("emailtemp")
    if os.path.isdir("emailtemp"):
        os.system('\"'+abspath("libraries/email_parser.exe")+'\"')
    emailpath, emaildirs, emailfiles = next(os.walk("emailtemp"))
    emailfilecount = len(emailfiles)
    print "Iteration "+str(emailvar7)+ " of " + emailvar6 +": "+str(emailfilecount)
    emailvar7 = emailvar7+1
    if (emailfilecount > emailvar8):
        emailvar8 = emailfilecount
print "The assumed number of files is " + str(emailvar8) + " files."

def getEFCount():
    emailpath, emaildirs, emailfiles = next(os.walk("emailtemp"))
    return len(emailfiles)

while (getEFCount() != emailvar8):
    try:
        shutil.rmtree("emailtemp")
    except:
        pass
    os.makedirs("emailtemp")
    if os.path.isdir("emailtemp"):
        os.system('\"'+abspath("libraries/email_parser.exe")+'\"')
    emailpath, emaildirs, emailfiles = next(os.walk("emailtemp"))
    emailfilecount = len(emailfiles)
    print "Current fetch: "+str(emailfilecount)+ " files."
print "CSV files successfully verified"
```
# Testing

The datafile must be copied into the working directory and renamed to "input.ost" or "input.pst". Below are some ways you can obtain a datafile.

You can use your own outlook datafiles (ost or pst) which are found in the following directory:

C:\Users\ **your_user_name** \AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\ **your_email_address** .xst

Otherwise, a sample ost file can be downloaded for testing from:
```
https://www.cfreds.nist.gov/data_leakage_case/data-leakage-case.html
```
Click on the Personal Computer (PC) â€“ 'DD' Image.

Once downloaded, use a tool like OSFMount to mount the image.
```
https://www.osforensics.com/tools/mount-disk-images.html
```
Inside the image, there is an outlook datafile at:
```
X:\Users\informant\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\iaman.informant@nist.gov.ost
```
